# UEFA-Euro-Prediction
Read about it in detail on Medium [Building a statistical model for predicting euro 2016 results by @siddhant_08](https://medium.com/@siddhant_08/building-a-statistical-model-for-predicting-euro-2016-results-946ea1561c8).
My model predicted Spain to win(finals against Germany) which made sense based on historical data ( Euro 08', 12' and WC 10' Winners) but I knew the odds were stacked against them as they have gone downhill since 2014.
Overall I got 44.44% accuracy for outcomes in the group stages. Predicting scores was going to be tough and I managed a pitiful 20% on that. I(user name signature) finished 18th from ~1200 people in [this online contest](http://www.thebigdatachallenge.com/uefa-euro-2016/en/results.html). 


Goldman Sachs made one too.Check it out [here](http://www.goldmansachs.com/our-thinking/macroeconomic-insights/euro-cup-2016/index.html).They took the ELO rankings of the teams to be the major parameters.
Google and others made their's too for the 2014 WC with Google in particular using a lot more complex models than others and taking individual players' characteristics into consideration as well. TODO for some time later.
